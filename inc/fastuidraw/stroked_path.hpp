      \endcode
      The computation for offset_vector() is as follows.
      - For those with offset_type() being StrokedPath::offset_edge,
        StrokedPath::offset_next_edge and StrokedPath::offset_shared_with_edge,
        the offset is given by
        \code

        In addition, for types StrokedPath::offset_edge and
        StrokedPath::offset_next_edge, \ref m_auxilary_offset
        holds the the delta vector to the point on edge with
        which the point makes a quad.
      - For those with offset_type() being StrokedPath::offset_square_cap,
        the value is given by
        \code
        m_pre_offset + 0.5 * m_auxilary_offset
        \endcode
        In addition, \ref m_auxilary_offset holds the vector leaving
        from the contour where the cap is located.
      - For those with offset_type() being StrokedPath::offset_miter_join
        or StrokedPath::cap_join_point, the value is given by the following
        code
        \code
        vec2 n = m_pre_offset, v = vec2(-n.y(), n.x());
        float r, lambda;
        lambda = -sign(dot(v, m_auxilary_offset));
        r = (dot(m_pre_offset, m_auxilary_offset) - 1.0) / dot(v, m_auxilary_offset);
        //result:
        offset = lambda * (n - r * v);
        \endcode
        To enfore a miter limit M, clamp the value r to [-M,M].
      - For those with offset_type() being StrokedPath::offset_rounded_cap,
        the value is given by the following code
        \code
        vec2 n(m_pre_offset), v(n.y(), -n.x());
        offset = m_auxilary_offset.x() * v + m_auxilary_offset.y() * n;
        \endcode
      - For those with offset_type() being StrokedPath::offset_rounded_join,
        the value is given by the following code
        \code
        vec2 cs;

        cs.x() = m_auxilary_offset.y();
        cs.y() = sqrt(1.0 - cs.x() * cs.x());

        if(m_packed_data & sin_sign_mask)
          cs.y() = -cs.y();

        offset = cs
        \endcode
        In addition, the source data for join is encoded as follows:
        \code
        float t;
        vec2 n0, n1;

        t = m_auxilary_offset.x();
        n0.x() = m_pre_offset.x();
        n1.x() = m_pre_offset.y();

        n0.y() = sqrt(1.0 - n0.x() * n0.x());
        n1.y() = sqrt(1.0 - n1.x() * n1.x());

        if(m_packed_data & normal0_y_sign_mask)
          n0.y() = -n0.y();

        if(m_packed_data & normal1_y_sign_mask)
          n1.y() = -n1.y();
        \endcode
        The vector n0 represents the normal of the path going into the join,
        the vector n1 represents the normal of the path going out of the join
        and t represents how much to interpolate from n0 to n1.
